# Machine-Learning-Capstone
This Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree capstone project is to solve the problem posed by a Kaggle competition called [Predict Future Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales).

## Data
The dataset for the project is provided by the competition.  The data files have been downloaded and placed in the [data folder of this project](data/provided).

## Code
There are 4 Jupyter notebooks for this project.  One notebook called _data_exploration.ipynb_ analyzes the data.  Another notebook called _data_preparation.ipynb_ preprocesses the data and creates a training file.  A quick and dirty evaluation of different regression algorithms is in a notebook named _regressor_evaluation.ipynb_.  The last notebook, _training.ipynb_, walks through the steps to train the model and create the submission file for the Kaggle competition.

## Coding Environment
The notebooks were created on my desktop computer.  My computer runs Ubuntu 16.04.5 and has version 3.6.5 of Python installed.  I used version 4.4.0 of Jupyter and installed the following version of these Python packages:
* numpy (1.14.3)
* pandas (0.23.0)
* mathplotlib (2.2.2)
* scikit-learn (0.19.1)
* xgboost (0.72.1)
* lightgbm (2.1.2)
* keras (2.2.2)
* tensorflow (1.10.1)
